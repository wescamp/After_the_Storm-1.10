After the Storm
================================================================================

**After the Storm** (**AtS**) is an add-on campaign for the
**[Battle for Wesnoth][1]**.

[1]: <http://www.wesnoth.org/>

This campaign is the immediate sequel to *Invasion from the Unknown*.

After the Emperor of Chaos was defeated, the free civilizations of the
Great Continent hoped that his followers would abandon the ongoing war.
Meanwhile, Galas and his unlikely band of heroes head back to the northern
lands to request aid for their next journey.

Later, the Chaos Empire still manages to make a stand against its enemies.
While the Grand Council is preoccupied with more pressing matters, the fragile
alliance of the peoples of the Far North is threatened by a new, mysterious
leader who seeks to invade their defenseless lands.

**(Intermediate level, three separate episodes with 13 scenarios each.)**

**NOTE:** Some scenarios of this campaign work significantly different from
normal Wesnoth gameplay. It is especially important to pay close attention to
the mission objectives and not necessarily try to kill every single enemy,
especially on shrouded maps, or in places where enemies seem to respawn
continuously.

Although not strictly required, players are advised to become familiar with the
stories, characters, and historical events presented in *Descent into Darkness*,
*Under the Burning Suns*, and especially *Invasion from the Unknown* before
playing this campaign.

A game screen resolution of **800x600 or greater** is recommended. Some
sequences make use of floating labels, halos, and standing unit animations, so

**Preferences** → **Display**.
