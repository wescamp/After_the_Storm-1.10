I understand that this implies that you, the elves and other faerie creatures, are descended, or at least based on Yechnagoth’s and Uria’s sister."

Perhaps it was not his intention to cause harm to *you* in particular, but the damage he caused throughout the continent, in the name of Uria... It hurt you, didn’t it? To make things worse, it seemed like Uria felt his loss. If he was a mere puppet of hers, would she have proclaimed her intentions to avenge her “emissary” like she did?"

No matter what Uria said, I’m certain that Lédinor was struggling to overcome her control all that time, resisting it long enough to help us, knowing that she’d win at the end.
