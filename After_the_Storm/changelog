===========================
AFTER THE STORM - CHANGELOG
===========================

Version 0.7.4:
--------------
* Graphics:
  * New or updated unit graphics: Shaxthal Warlord Nar-Hamoth

* Music:
  * All current music tracks have been moved to a separate add-on,
    imaginatively titled "AtS Music". This add-on is now an optional dependency
    for those who can't afford downloading it or don't play with music enabled.
    When absent, the AtS campaign menu entries for each episode will include a
    notice stating so.

* Scenarios:
  * E2S5 - The Eastern Front:
    * Added a time-over dialog sequence.
    * Added an additional dialog sequence focusing on a specific
      player character.
  * E2S6 - The Voyage Home:
    * Added a time-over dialog sequence.
  * E2S7 - Proximus:
    * Added a time-over dialog sequence.

    * Fixed multiple "invalid WML array index" warnings at the start.
    * Reduced starting gold.

    * Made the glyph guardians a little more competent.

    same turn.

* Units:
  * Balancing:
    * Increased arcane damage resistance for most Shaxthal units from -50% to
      -20%.
    * Decreased Demon Zephyr's movement cost on deep water terrains from 2 to 1.
    * Decreased Demon Zephyr's movement cost on unwalkable terrains from 3 to 1.
  * Reimplemented NPC bird behavior code in Lua.
  * Renamed "Shaxthal Warlord" unit type to "Shaxthal Warlord Narhamoth";
    this breaks old saved games of E1S9.1 (The Triad, part 1) during turns.

        it to 0%.
