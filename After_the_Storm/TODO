======================================
AFTER THE STORM DEVELOPMENT TO-DO LIST
======================================

  Legend: [!] Important - [L] Low - [D] Lowest/Wishlist - [M] 1.0.0 target -
          [?] Undecided/Tentative - [x] Done

* General
  * [D] Distribute resources in a separate add-on used by IftU and AtS
    * Depends on the implementation of different add-on dependency tiers in
      mainline code
  * [M] Optimize usage of SUFs and SLFs throughout the entire campaign
  * [M] Make better use of new 1.10 WML features (used mostly post-Divergence)
        throughout the entire campaign

* Balancing [M]
  * [L] E1S3 (make it harder to win by just sitting in a map corner)
  * [L] E1S7 (increase difficulty)
  * [!] E1S9.2 (increase difficulty)
  * [L] E1S10 (decrease difficulty)
  * [!] E1S11.1 (increase difficulty by making a specific side use offensive
    rather than defensive grouping)
  * [!] E1S11.2 (increase difficulty)
  * [L] E2S1 (increase difficulty)
  * [L] E2S2 (decrease difficulty)
  * [!] E2S8 (increase difficulty)
  * [L] E2S9 (increase/make difficulty level more deterministic)
  * [L] E2S10 (increase difficulty of the second half)
  * [!] E2S11 (increase difficulty of the second half)
  * [!] E3S3 (make Nar-hamoth's encounter more interesting, maybe extend his
    appearance for two whole turns for milking XP)
  * [!] E3S7A.1 (increase gameplay fluidity)
  * [!] E3S7B (decrease amount of enemy leaders and units spawned after turn 10
    for performance and difficulty concerns, increase difficulty in some other
    way to compensate)
  * [L] E3S10 (increase gameplay fluidity before Zhangor stage)

* Cutscenes
  * E1S9.2
    * [M] The sequence with Ivyel needs to be rewritten to make it more
      interesting and difficult
  * E2S12
    * [M] Include a short appearance of Uria (projected) during Elynia's death
      sequence
  * E2S4
    * [L] May need style changes and review

* Units (with currently finished art)
  * [M] Ivyel (E1S9.2 appearance) needs better/more interesting stats
  * [?] Elynia needs AMLAs for E2
    * [M] Depending on this, she might need a better unit type for E3 that
      always incorporates previous AMLAs, and provides new ones; although
      plot-wise, the more logical action would be to level her down in E3.

      obvious base

    * [L] Mal Hekuba (E2S11 appearance) needs his own baseframe
    * [M] Chaos Dreadcrafter, a mage/engineer/medic unit with healing
    * Degraded bosses and heroes
