I thought I could save Irdya from impending doom this time, but I failed. I failed utterly, just like I did before, and again.

But who spoke to me before Anya woke me up? Who could be interested in our success? Could it be the fabled Guardian of the Arcane Flame herself? Could it be I’m merely losing my mind because of everything that has happened since Galas and Mal Keshar woke me up?

I have always been rather skeptical about these matters, but the little information we have gathered so far suggests the Guardian—often referred to as Eloh—is as real as Uria is, or at the very least she was. But if she truly lives, why hasn’t she helped us? It’s evident we have not been graced by her divine powers for as long as we have existed.

The lowliest of individuals of any given species tend to be gullible like that — and that is obviously something Uria and her minions knew.

I did not ask the girl what seemed to cause her more pain than before. Was it the many modifications we had to perform on her devastated body to enable her to live once again, or the separation of her body and her soul? Or perhaps... the presence of the Source within her.

Her name..."

Upon our return to the village, we saw the aftermath of the carnage.

Her people were not conquered and enslaved like it is the norm for other demon lords. No... the malefactor behind the bloodshed had a very specific goal in mind: ensuring that the foretold Era of Unity would never come to pass. Dorvoth of the Valdemons did not know anything more specific about the girl who would become the new Guardian of Life than her species, so the logical step for him was methodical genocide."

Decades later, Dorvoth did not just meet the girl who was always predestined to end him, but an enraged goddess bent on his destruction. A goddess who had just learned that creating or restoring life was not amongst the powers naturally conferred to her by the Tree.

He never stood a chance against the goddess who went on to adopt the name of her predecessor as her own."

The Seer told her that Yarae consciously chose to prevent us from reaching his tier of power, placing various restrictions in the design of our universe. Restrictions that could be overcome or exploited given sufficient time and research. Restrictions that Delethia herself may have managed to break in order to create the Gatekeepers and her other rumored progeny. Restrictions that could be abolished with the various instruments left behind by the First Gods.

Uria began to see our universe not as a system which she was meant to heal and protect, but rather as an inherently flawed creation that needed to be replaced."

Over time, Uria defeated every single Demon Lord in her path and forced them to either join her cause or be completely destroyed... along with their own kind. She established a new power hierarchy where she would always be at the top, with the belligerent Demon Lords forced to serve her for as long as they lived. It did not take her much time to crush all those who were opposed to the new order.

From every conquered race, Uria would learn something new; for the peoples of Urvatha are all descended from survivors of the First Cycle, and some of them managed to preserve some ancient knowledge to this day."

The goal: creating a new, perfect universe in which life would be completely controlled by her will; a universe without death; a universe without Yarae’s creations; and most importantly, a universe where she would be the only ruling goddess.

But to achieve that goal, she would have to cope with the power growing inside her; the power of the guardians, drawn from the Source amidst the endless void beyond our universe; unlimited power.

It is clear now that she failed to escape from the nefarious tendrils of that corrupting power."

If anyone finds this journal, they will learn the truth. But I also want them to ensure that Elynia will do as well. And then, when the time comes, she will know what to do. And she will know that she does not need to mourn my death.
