Although not strictly required, players are advised to become familiar with the stories, characters, and historical events presented in <i>Descent into Darkness</i>, <i>Under the Burning Suns</i>, and especially <i>Invasion from the Unknown</i> before playing this campaign.

<b>If you have not completed Episodes I and II of <i>After the Storm</i>, you definitely should not play this episode yet.</b>"

But who spoke to me before Anya woke me up? Who could be interested in our success? Could it be the fabled Guardian of the Arcane Flame herself?

I have always been rather skeptical about these matters, but the little information we have gathered so far suggests the Guardian—often referred to as Eloh—is as real as Uria is, or at the very least she was. But if she truly lives, why hasn’t she helped us? It’s evident we have not been graced by her divine powers for as long as we have existed.

The lowliest of individuals of any given species tend to be gullible like that — and that is obviously something Uria and her minions knew.

Just as Valen previously assured us, they were still alive and in one piece, and they were in Fort Astar, and they had the journal.

The mere act of thought demands more effort than it used to, as if my very mind was falling apart. Recent events have only increased this feeling of detachment from reality.

It was only a few days ago, in the Heart. While I was inspecting Reghara’s prisoners, he mockingly alluded to his men and their toy. “What toy?”, I asked. He somehow assumed I am concerned enough with their leisure ‘activities’ to have heard of this depravity beyond description; these Irdyans should be thankful that Uria will not let me give them what they all deserve at once."

I did not ask the girl what seemed to cause her more pain than before. Was it the many modifications we had to perform on her devastated body to enable her to live once again, or the separation of her body and her soul? Or perhaps... the presence of the Source within her.
