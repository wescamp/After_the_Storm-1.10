From that temple they learned the ways of fire magic, and the song of Shardia, She who forged knowledge from the fire of our hearts.

They thrived with their newfound knowledge and the protection granted by the precipitous mountain range. They continued to learn from Her, and longed for the day when She would come to this earth and bless it with her song. And so did we.

He said he brought a message for us from the so-called Goddess of Life from beyond the Void, Uria, who had tasked him with the mission of spreading her voice to all non-believers in this land. But we would worship no more than the one Goddess who gave us our fire magic. We dismissed the dark prophet’s words as the blasphemous ramblings of a barbarian we assumed they were.

In time, we would be proven wrong.")}

Everyone was slaughtered by the monsters. Everyone except me, my brother, and a child with beautiful hair, said to be the heiress of Her fire; for never before we saw one of our own be born with the same hair color as our Goddess. But we lost her to the walking vultures of the desert, who took her as their own along with whatever was left of our civilization. They spared her life, seeing as she was but a child, but our own fate was vastly different.")}

We vowed to take revenge upon the shadow courier who brought disgrace upon our kind, and anyone who ever approached him in life. This would allow us to either be destroyed and released from our prison at last, or extend our curse to those creatures we abhorred.
