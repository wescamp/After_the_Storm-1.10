Actually, you do not consider the title befitting of your actual role. Ever since you recovered from the gruesome attack of Zhangor’s beasts, Ergea has used you as an instrument to liberate both her people and Irdya from Uria’s influence. They call you the “Dark Lady”, “Yechnagoth revived”, the “Goddess of Darkness”, and a myriad other titles you do not actually deserve or care for.

You feel like a pawn in someone’s game. But you are not quite sure anymore whether you are playing for the good side or the bad side.

Things were far easier when Elynia was around. You admired her stalwart sense of righteousness. You admired her courage in confronting the most fearsome enemies faced by Irdya in this era; enemies once thought invincible, now fallen and destroyed forever."

You grew up hearing of Elynia’s feats from Elorran and Tara. Now that you are nearly at her same level and know more about her, it all suddenly feels vain and pointless. So many things could have been avoided if Uria and her people did not monopolize access to knowledge about your destiny...

A sentiment of uselessness suddenly overwhelms you. You are a fraud. You have not even been able to control the darkness that keeps Naia and Sela’s light from reaching Irdya’s surface. For how long does Ergea intend you to play your act for the Chaos rebels?"

Elynia told you to trust your heart, but you are not quite sure you can do that anymore. After all, it was your heart that deceived you in the first place; it blinded you to Elynia’s actual plan, and it fooled you into thinking that perhaps she would ever consider you as anything more than a ‘friend’."
